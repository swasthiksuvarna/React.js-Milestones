# React.js-Milestones

This repository now contains the `Review-worked` consolidated frontend milestone projects.

## Review-worked (consolidated projects)

This repository consolidates the frontend milestone projects into a single top-level repository for easier review and management.

Included projects

- fend_mm1/
- fend_mm2/
- fend_mm3/
- fend_mm7/

Notes

- Each project originally contained its own git history. Those `.git` directories have been backed up to `.git-backups/` inside this repository (one backup per project) to preserve history before absorbing the projects into this top-level repo.
- This repository is configured to use rebase as the default pull/merge strategy (see `git config pull.rebase`).

If you want the original repositories preserved as separate remotes/submodules instead of absorbing them, I can restore them from the backups and convert them to submodules.
